    <p>Once youâ€™ve used Clarify for the first time you should have a better idea of what your brand is. Whilst you'll see the benefits of simply knowing this, it's also worth reviewing how you currently communicate it.</p>

    <p>Your brand is communicated in a number of ways, both by yourself and others. For example, any document, website or even email signature should have a visual identity that quickly communicates the key elements of your brand.</p>

Your brand should also dictate the tone and content of any copy you write, affect the types of conversations you should be having on social media, and more profoundly - when you consider the purpose of what you do - the future direction of your organisation.</p>
