            <h3>Market example 1</h3>
            <p>A UK business-support company recognised that their audience are individuals seeking to turn their passion into a business. Or put another way, rather than thinking their market is anyone starting a business they identified the thousands of ‘kitchen-table start-ups’ through the UK. Clearly defining their target audience has allowed them to focus on this audience - both with the tone and type content they produce, their visual style, and in the new tools they're looking to develop in the future.</p>

            <h3>Market example 2</h3>
            <p>A business based in the UK specialises in Chinese social media for UK brands. Their market can be literally any UK business who want to better communicate with Chinese consumers through Chinese social media. This is a large market, so they have selected a few specific sectors to focus on. Sometimes it’s necessary to be selective and not try and throw your net too wide.</p>

              <p>Identifying your competition is an important first step.</p>
              <p>In analysing your competition can you identify what they are doing that you aren’t, or can you see how they present themselves both in written content and visually? Are you clearly identifiable from your competition? You don’t want to be confused for someone else, or them to be confused for you. Your definition of who you are as a business should not be reliant on referencing your competition, but that doesn’t mean that you should ignore them. It is useful to know how you differ from your competitors, and in what areas you might have a competitive advantage.</p>

              <p>As with your market, be aware that your competitors are always developing and changing themselves, and new competition is always being added.</p>

            <h3>Competition example 1</h3>
            <p>The competition for an online brand development tool - (ring any bells?) - extends beyond other online tools. Books, blog posts and videos, talks, brand agencies and brand consultants all compete for the same attention and revenue. Defining their competitors in a broader sense has allowed the creators to focus on points of difference - both in functionality and the way they communicate.</p>

            <p>A London-based management consultancy found that their competition included some very large businesses, or more specifically a certain section of very large businesses who specialise in a similar offering. Your competition may not simply be businesses who are of a similar size to you.</p>
